## Issue Triage Process

Our project uses community triage to help manage issues effectively. Here's how it works:

1. New issues automatically get the `needs-triage` label
2. Community members from the triage team can vote on issues:
   - Use 👍 reaction to vote for confirming the issue
   - Use 💭 reaction to request more information
   - Use 👎 reaction to vote for closing the issue

3. An issue needs 2 positive votes from triage team members to be confirmed
4. Once confirmed:
   - The `needs-triage` label is removed
   - The `triaged` label is added
   - The issue is ready for assignment

### Triage Team Responsibilities:
- Verify issue completeness
- Confirm bug reproducibility
- Check for duplicates
- Assess priority
- Suggest labels
- Request additional information if needed

### How to Join the Triage Team:
1. Consistently contribute to the project
2. Show good judgment in existing issue discussions
3. Request team membership from maintainers
